## ‚ö° Getting Started: Unleash Shellmind

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

*   **Rust:** Install Rust via `rustup` from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
*   **A Gemini API Key:** Obtain your API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
*   **Protocol Buffers Compiler (`protoc`):** Required for gRPC support. Install it via your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler` on Debian/Ubuntu).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/shellmind.git
    cd shellmind
    ```

2.  **Configure Your API Key:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key:

    ```dotenv
    SHELLMIND_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set it as an environment variable or configure it via the CLI after building.

3.  **Build Shellmind:**

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

### Usage

#### Interactive Mode

For a continuous, interactive AI assistant session:

```bash
cargo run --bin shellmind
```

Type your natural language queries, and Shellmind will provide the corresponding shell commands. Type `exit` to quit.

#### Direct Command Line Queries

For quick, one-off command generation:

```bash
cargo run --bin shellmind prompt --text "list all files in current directory"
```

#### CLI Configuration

View your current configuration:

```bash
cargo run --bin shellmind config show
```

Set a configuration value (e.g., change the model or API type):

```bash
cargo run --bin shellmind config set model_name gemini-1.5-pro
cargo run --bin shellmind config set api_type grpc
cargo run --bin shellmind config set grpc_endpoint https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com
cargo run --bin shellmind config set system_prompt "You are a helpful assistant for Rust programming."
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

Shellmind's behavior can be customized via a `config.toml` file located in `~/.shellmind/` or through environment variables prefixed with `SHELLMIND_` (e.g., `SHELLMIND_API_KEY`).

Key configuration options include:

*   `api_key`: Your Gemini API key. (Required)
*   `model_name`: The specific Gemini model to use (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`).
*   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the AI's output (0.0 to 1.0). Lower values produce more deterministic results.
*   `context_window_size`: The maximum number of previous turns to include in the conversation history sent to the AI.
*   `api_type`: Specifies whether to use `Rest` (default) or `Grpc` for API communication.
*   `grpc_endpoint`: The gRPC endpoint URL if `api_type` is set to `Grpc`.
*   `system_prompt`: The initial instruction or persona given to the AI. Customize this to tailor Shellmind's responses.
